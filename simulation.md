## Initialization
Parameters serves as the inputs of the simulation, in JSON format. In `input/parameters.json`ï¼Œparameters are adjustable for simulation set-up. Below is a brief introduction to these parameters.
- **Compulsory parameters**:
    - `round`: integer, the number of rounds for a simulation.
    - `timestep`: integer, the number of steps within a round.
    - `is_derected`: either `true` or `false`. This suggests whether the social network is a directed graph or not.
    - `is_external_dataset`: either `ture` or `false`. If the value is `true`, suggests to use external datasets after conversion. `false` uses the synthetic random network.
    - `broadcasting_prob`: a float value in the range between [0,1]. This is the broadcasting probability of each user agent to get the inital broadcasting message, and therefore functions as a seed user.
- **Optional parameters**:
    You can define ***social network*** in **one of these ways** with the optional parameters:
  1. Use synthetic network: a random network based on Erdos-Renyi model is built with self-defined values, powered by Networkx. Some parameters need to be assigned to construct this synthetic network:
     1. `node_size`: integer, the number of nodes in a graph.
     2. `connect_prob`: float in the range between [0,1]. This is the probability of the nodes connecting to each other. 
  2. Use external dataset: alternatively, we support real-world dataset to be used for the simulation, through our conversion tool provided in `dataset_conversion_tool.py`. 
     Conversion tool support input dataset in a `TXT` format. An example of the dataset is like
      ```
      30	1412
      30	3352
      3	54
      ```
      Each line suggests an edge between node i and node j. If this was a directed network, nominate it in `input/parameter.json` by setting `is_directed` equals `ture`. So that it represents a directed edge from node i to node j.
      
      Run `python tools/dataset_tool.py -d dataset_file_name` so the input TXT file will be saved in `saved/graph.G` directly.

## Information Propagation
When a piece of news is released to the public via platforms like newspapers or websites, every member (or agent) of a social network has an equal opportunity to access this news. Once an agent reads the news, they begin sharing it with their neighbors within the network.

As the news spreads, the propagation is not just a simple relay of information. Instead of merely passing along the news as is, agents engage interactively. This means when an agent shares the news with a neighbor, they also express their thoughts, opinions, or reactions to the news. Meanwhile, once a neighbor is influenced by the spreading information, it is respond with its own opinions and reactions.

The information propagation ends if there is no user agents can be influenced.
