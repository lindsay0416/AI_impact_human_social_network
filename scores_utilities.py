# This function is about the message retrieve:
# we consider those 3 parameters share the same weight. a=b=c=1/3
# correlation_sore = a*similarity + b*timestamp + c*frequencyï¼Œabc are coefficients.
# timestamp can take into account the time difference:
# The time difference between the (received/sent) messages to be scored and the timestamp of the simulation message.
