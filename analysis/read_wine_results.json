          "1":"arp I agree but sometimes the pitchman is right Roger Federers dreamy hawking of the Jura line of coffee makers is an example of an exception product promoted by an exception athleteand they are both Swiss of course\n",
          "2":"Rarely has anybody sought to advocate for wine or other alcoholic beverages simply as pleasures because they taste and feel good Ive never understood why this is especially too when the same sentiment is applied to fuel When I see heath article after health article with experts baffled as to why people eat certain foods I wonder why they talk about hidden psychological trauma instead of the simple fact that certain foods are pleasurable to eat and are done for that reason Its blatantly obvious that people eat and drink for pleasure and that pleasureseeking behaviour is a base drive for people yet we try to explain such behaviour without reference to that It seems little more than puritan moralism couched in scientific language\n",
          "3":"Kel Yes so much this We are trained by diet culture to justify everything we eat and drink as if they only reason to ever do so is purely for fuel or nutrition Its a sad state of society that were moralizing around food with such nearreligious fervor and grouping ourselves by what we will and wont eat No wonder there is so much disordered eating in this country\n"

          "1":"Sarah One of the first lessons that my mother taught me was You can never be too rich or too thin She added Fat people cant have class I was too young to know what class meant but I got the message She added that I looked like a butterball Photos of me as a child reveal that I may have been about five pounds overweight I put myself on a diet I told my best friends mother that I didnt like pizza when offered pizza at my best friends birthday party I recall feeling so sad after I returned from the party I loved pizza Of course I had not eaten the birthday cake Of course I went on to develop a fullblown eating disorder Three of my four siblings suffer from disordered eating Those whom I know who have eating disorders have them as a result of their parents obsession with food weight body image the parents criticism of childrens bodies weight parents attempts to control childrens food intake and weight Thin people are viewed as superior to overweight individuals in American society Fat shaming fuels disordered eating and full blown eating disorders Parents who attempt to control their childrens food intake can be sure that the children will find that food elsewhere should start saving for eating disorder treatment and for the expensive dental work that will be needed if their children go on to become bulimic\n",
          "2":"Years ago when I was marketing and sales director for a large firm making and selling wine Our master wine maker Dick Peterson said when one of our wines was very good its in the bottle All of this palaver about being a clean wine is irrelevant\n",
          "3":"Interesting I thought only nasty Republicans ignored science For your information there is no scientific evidence that organic anything is better for your health Check it out\n"

          "1":"Salute skol sante and all the rest When it comes to wine advice I rely on Mr Asimov I rely on Cameron Diaz as much as I rely on Roger Federer for advice on watches and coffee makers and on Tiger Woods for cars I resolve to be even more dismissive of celebrity endorsements\n",
          "2":"The best commentary Ive seen on whether wine is a positive good was from Robert Capon Episcopal priest and cookbook author who said God put sugar inside the grape and yeasts on the outside and meant it I imagine there might be people with food allergies who might benefit from the information on processing\n",
          "3":"Wine is good But if you have asthma watch out for the sulfites even in socalled clean wines Too much sulfite can trigger an asthma attack\n"
