            "marie i drink wine in a very similar fashion basically any wine that you buy at a national chain store or supermarket that is distributed nationally will most likely have the additives and stabilizers there is no other way to make a million cases of the same product be consistent best advice is to visit a wine shop and tell them what youre looking for small producer natural wine for or less i guarantee you theyll have some great options",
            "rea i only buy from wine shops",
            "marie but this doesnt help because putting in additives and processing is not done by any shopkeeper as long as a wine a regulation allows additives and processing you have to assume that this is done by the producers except a producer is able to guarantee explicitely and trustworthily that his specific product is free from this because american wine regulation is allowing additives and processing to a relatively wide extent you must be aware that there are additives in an ordinary us wine when nothing is said on the label if there is no special label like organic by some fragmented organisations just because such treatment is economically advangeous for mass producers european wine regulation does not allow processing in general and is approving only a small range of additives like sulfites unevitable particularly when the wine is labeled bio these strict legal statutes are even more tightened so because of such legal provisions and control it is consistent that ms diaz has picked big european bio producers she isnt so naive as she may sound sometimes im not aware about the legal situation in south america australia and new zealand but as far as i know this is much closer to the european situation",

            "theres no harm in making a buck or a million out of wine ms diaz is clever enough not to buy a winery avoiding the adage of how to make a million dollars in a winery start with several millions of dollars if she is able to increase the community of wine drinkers i am all for it however ill stick to my wine stores selling old world wines along with domestic and other new world wines it is interesting however she picked old world winemakers they have perfected it over the centuries she made the right choice",

            "jayce i completely agree i feel like too many people are not comfortable going into a wine shop because some have the perception that its all too expensive and its simply not true my local wine manager loves to help and wants to know upfront the occasion and the budget and yes they have great bottles",

            "it was interesting reading this article yesterday on science fiction day the date chosen because it was the birthday of mr asimovs uncle there is a lot of science fiction coming out of the clean wine claims or at least science manipulation in the form of their product marketing they perpetuate the misnomer that any wine that came before them was heavily manipulated which itself is a heavy manipulation of the truth better made wines using better agricultural practices and lower intervention wine making processes have always been around yes the natural wine movement has brought more attention to it and more confusion to it too but for many winemakers and many regions it is not something new it is standard practice sometimes for centuries it is funny too that many of these clean brands have a lot in common in some ways with many of the most popular foodprocessed and additiveenhanced wines mass production distributed and marketed by large entities with large advertising budgets ultimately though wine is a matter of personal taste and choice i choose to try to spend my money whenever possible on the smaller players in the supply chain wineries retailers distributors importers who i think provide the best quality and value and pass on the clean wines and double pass on the celebrity winemakers unless they are actually making wine",

            "thank you for commenting on sulfite preservatives as i am sensitive to sulfites i avoid most wines a few brands avoid adding sulfites yes i know that there are naturally occurring sulfites so i am able to enjoy those brands thankfully labels do note sulfite additions labeling a product clean while adding sulfites is a misnomer",

            "excellent article both for pushing us to visit wine specialty stores and learn more about what they consume but also for this obvious statement many wish to deny no matter how a wine is made it contains one inherently dangerous substance alcohol drinking too much wine is risky no matter how it is made the alcohol will do the harm not the host of legal additives or trace remnants of herbicides or pesticides i drink wine and other alcoholic beverages and enjoy them responsibly yet the search for organic clean wines reminds me a little of my friend who smokes organic tobacco cigarettes",
            "if you can find wonderful organic wines why would you drink anything else i was thrilled several years ago to discover a wine labeled our daily red made from organic grapes sold in my local grocery store for a bottle after trying several bottles of this deep red wine i realized i felt better drinking it than any of the other wines i bought it had a rich yet gentle mouth experience with a long pleasant finish each sip precious cases followed i gifted the lovely wine without disclosing the humble price friends were thrilled then in march of that year the batch ran out i could no longer find it i waited eagerly for the next years batch the next year it was just as wonderful and i knew to score several cases in time for it to disappear i then moved and could not longer find it just the other day there it was at a local store on the island i had moved to now it costs and it is still organic and still wonderful it is described as a blend of fresno syrah and carignan and mendocino cabernet sauvignon and it will continue to star as my single evening glass of ounces of red wine having compared it head to head with more expensive and nonorganic wines in blind taste tests with cheerful guests and friends",
            "because although i dont actually drink it anymore that alcohol thing dont ya know organic isnt all that important to me particularly given all the other ills associated with the making of wine organic doesnt guarantee that the profits go to the right place or that the land couldnt or shouldnt be used for something else to put it bluntly whether wine is organic or not is so far below the things actually worth worrying about that im not giving it any mind space and dont know why you would worry about fair wages for the farm workers and the warehouse folks not about whether youre sullying your lips with trace chemicals",
