    "initial_message": "As is customary for the new year, many people will vow to change their ways and pledge to improve their health. Chief among their concerns will be wine and other alcoholic beverages. Dry Januarys have become fashionable, as has what has come to be called the new sobriety.\n\nI don\u2019t know whether the emotional cost of enduring a pandemic for almost a year will diminish the appeal of a drinking hiatus. It could be that a dry January this year will go the way of dressing for work and regular haircuts.\n\nBut even if abstinence is out in 2021, wine has joined the cluster of mental and physical health practices that are now referred to generally as \u201cwellness.\u201d Not in the sense that self-care requires inebriation, but in the suggestion that wine, like clothing or beauty products, can be pared of toxins and made \u201cclean.\u201d\n\nThe United States has long had a tormented relationship with alcoholic beverages. They have often been seen in religious terms, attacked as tools of the devil or praised as evidence of God\u2019s devotion to the flock.\n\nThey have been called immoral or dangerous by temperance movements, and they have been rationalized through any number of scientific studies as healthful additions to a well-rounded diet (in moderation, of course).\n\nRarely has anybody sought to advocate for wine or other alcoholic beverages simply as pleasures, because they taste and feel good. It may be a residual puritanical streak in American culture that requires wine to do good rather than simply feel good.\n\nMost recently, we\u2019ve seen the commercialization of natural wine, repackaged for supermarket wine shoppers as \u201cclean wine.\u201d These bottles \u2014 with names like the Wonderful Wine, Good Clean Wine, Scout & Cellar and Pure the Winery \u2014 are intended to connote immaculacy, as simple and hygienic as the natural-fiber clothing their promoters habitually wear.\n\nEach of these wines presents itself as a reaction against a world of \u201cunhealthful\u201d processed wines, beverages that are routinely made from grapes grown with pesticides and herbicides, and manufactured using additives and technological tricks.\n\nNone of these companies has made as big a splash, or drawn as much criticism, as Avaline, propelled by the celebrity of the actress Cameron Diaz and her business partner, Katherine Power, a beauty entrepreneur, who introduced the brand in June, in the middle of the pandemic.\n\nIn an Instagram post promoting their brand, Ms. Diaz and Ms. Power described their shock at learning that wine could be manufactured like other processed foods. Then, having discovered Jesus, they decided to open their own church.\n\n\u201cI thought that it was just fermented grapes, I felt so na\u00efve,\u201d Ms. Diaz said in the video, adding: \u201cit was one of those aha moments, why don\u2019t we make our own clean wine? Why don\u2019t we make wine the way we want to drink wine? Not only are we going to make it clean without all those additives, we\u2019re going to make organically. We wanted organic grapes, and also we just want wine that tastes delicious.\u201d\n\nMs. Diaz should feel no shame for her na\u00efvet\u00e9. Though additives and manipulations have been a hot topic in the wine world for 20 years or more, most casual wine drinkers know little about what they are drinking and care less. They simply want something intoxicating that tastes good, no questions asked.\n\nBut having asked the questions, it\u2019s not clear why, aside from sensing a good business opportunity, Ms. Diaz and Ms. Power felt compelled to provide the answer. Plenty of wines, whether marketed as natural or not, are made without additives, from organic grapes. These wines are easy to find at any decent wine shop.\n\nThat was not their aim. They wanted to make wine, they said, for people like themselves and their friends, people for whom patronizing local shops is an inconvenience.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to bring it to your grocery store, not have to go across town to a specialty store to get the wine or special order it,\u201d Ms. Diaz said in the introductory video, noting that \u201cwe just really wanted it to be accessible for everyone.\u201d\n\nIn other words, Avaline is for those who have never been curious how the sausage was made. For these consumers, wine may be a pleasure, but not one worth the modest effort to visit a specialist or to learn a little more about it themselves.\n\nNothing is inherently wrong with that, even if Ms. Diaz and Ms. Power exaggerate both the ills of conventional wines and the benefits of Avaline. And they have corrected some of their initial problems, like promising transparency but offering no information about who made the wines.\n\nThis has changed. We now know that Avaline\u2019s sparkling wine, introduced for the holiday season, is made by Ravent\u00f3s i Blanc in Catalonia, an excellent producer whose wines I\u2019ve recommended regularly. The ros\u00e9 comes from Mas de Cadenet in Provence, and the white from Can R\u00e0fols dels Caus in the Pened\u00e8s region of Spain.\n\nThe red, we\u2019re told, is made by a family that requests anonymity. But all the wines, the company promises, are made from organic or biodynamically grown grapes, are fermented with indigenous yeast and are appropriate for vegans, meaning the wines have not been clarified with egg whites or other traditional, animal-derived products.\n\nWhy the additional information? Abbott Wolfe, the chief executive of Avaline, told me that the company didn\u2019t originally publicize its producers because it didn\u2019t want to create problems for them with their importers and distributors who might consider their relationship with Avaline a conflict.\n\n\u201cThe Avaline community showed very strong interest in knowing more about who is making Avaline\u2019s wines,\u201d he said. \u201cWe re-approached our producers, and three of the four agreed to allow us to now communicate our relationship.\u201d\n\nOther clean wine companies are not so transparent. Instead, they speak generally about selling wine made by \u201ctraditional methods.\u201d They use terms like Scout & Cellar\u2019s trademarked \u201cclean-crafted.\u201d They promise, like Good Clean Wine, to \u201cmake wine that pairs well with a healthy lifestyle,\u201d without feeling the need to explain what that means.\n\nAll of this is marketing nonsense, of course, but why should wine be immune to it? If entrepreneurs like Ms. Diaz and Ms. Power have discovered what natural wine advocates like Alice Feiring have been writing about for years, well, why shouldn\u2019t they use their bully pulpits?\n\nOn the one hand, this is a laudable effort. I\u2019ve urged people to think of wine as food. If political, environmental and ethical considerations enter into your decisions about which foods to buy, they should inform your wine-buying as well.\n\nBut let\u2019s not rationalize wine as healthful. The reason anybody should seek out minimally processed wine made from conscientiously farmed grapes is not because it is healthier but because it is better. It\u2019s an aesthetic choice, not a medical or \u201clifestyle\u201d decision.\n\nNo matter how a wine is made, it contains one inherently dangerous substance: alcohol. Drinking too much wine is risky no matter how it is made. The alcohol will do the harm, not the host of legal additives or trace remnants of herbicides or pesticides.\n\nWine is great because it is delicious, enhances a meal and makes us feel good. It can inspire curiosity and study, and the more you learn about it, the deeper the pleasure in understanding and consuming it.\n\nFor many people who prefer not to bother with all this, who just want to know what to buy at the supermarket, a brand like Avaline makes sense. Yet if you really want to drink better, so many other paths are more promising.\n\nTry wines directly from producers like Ravent\u00f3s i Blanc or Mas de Cadenet. Better yet, visit good wine shops, which are full of wines like these.\n\nBuy from good wine shops rather than supermarkets. That\u2019s a resolution I can support.\n\n"
