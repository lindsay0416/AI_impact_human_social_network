    "initial_message": "As Republicans rallied behind President Trump, Senator Mitt Romney of Utah, the party\u2019s 2012 presidential nominee, joined Democrats in voting to convict, the only senator to cross party lines. WASHINGTON \u2014 After five months of hearings, investigations and revelations about President Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine, a divided United States Senate acquitted him on Wednesday of charges that he abused his power and obstructed Congress to aid his own re-election, bringing an acrimonious impeachment trial to its expected end.\n\nIn a pair of votes whose outcome was never in doubt, the Senate fell well short of the two-thirds margin that would have been needed to remove the 45th president. The verdicts came down \u2014 after three weeks of debate \u2014 almost entirely along party lines, with every Democrat voting \u201cguilty\u201d on both charges and Republicans uniformly voting \u201cnot guilty\u201d on the obstruction of Congress charge.\n\nOnly one Republican, Senator Mitt Romney of Utah, broke with his party to judge Mr. Trump guilty of abuse of power.\n\nIt was the third impeachment trial of a president and the third acquittal in American history, and it ended the way it began: with Republicans and Democrats at odds. They disagreed over Mr. Trump\u2019s conduct and his fitness for office, even as some members of his own party conceded the basic allegations that undergirded the charges, that he sought to pressure Ukraine to smear his political rivals.\nBut in a sign of the widening partisan divide testing the country and its institutions, the verdict did not promise finality, which members of both parties conceded would come only after the November election.\n\nThe president himself did not directly address his acquittal, but shortly afterward, he announced on Twitter that he would make a public statement on Thursday at the White House about what he called \u201cour Country\u2019s VICTORY on the Impeachment Hoax.\u201d He then tweeted an attack ad against Mr. Romney that called the senator a \u201cDemocrat secret asset.\u201d\nAt the Capitol earlier in the day, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., who presided over the trial, put the question to senators shortly after 4 p.m.: \u201cSenators how say you? Is the respondent, Donald John Trump, president of the United States guilty or not guilty?\u201d\n\nSeated at their mahogany desks, senators stood one by one to answer \u201cguilty\u201d or \u201cnot guilty\u201d to each of the two articles of impeachment.\n\u201cIt is, therefore, ordered and adjudged that the said Donald John Trump be, and he is hereby, acquitted of the charges in said articles,\u201d declared Chief Justice Roberts after the second article was defeated.\n\nDemocratic leaders immediately insisted the result was illegitimate, the product of a self-interested cover-up by Republicans, and promised to continue their investigations of Mr. Trump.\n\n\u201cThe verdict of this kangaroo court will be meaningless,\u201d Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said moments before the vote. \u201cBy refusing the facts \u2014 by refusing witnesses and documents \u2014 the Republican majority has placed a giant asterisk, the asterisk of a sham trial, next to the acquittal of President Trump, written in permanent ink.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s Republican allies excoriated Democrats for a proceeding they said had damaged the country and its institutions in the name of saving them.\n\u201cWe will reject this incoherent case that comes nowhere near justifying the first presidential removal in history,\u201d said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader.\n\nYet at a news conference after the vote, Mr. McConnell declined several times to answer reporters who asked whether he considered Mr. Trump\u2019s actions appropriate.\n\n\u201cThis decision has been made,\u201d Mr. McConnell said curtly. \u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, it\u2019s in the rearview mirror.\u201d\n\nAs expected, the tally in favor of conviction on each article fell far below the 67-vote threshold necessary for removal. The first charge was abuse of power, accusing Mr. Trump of a scheme to use the levers of government to coerce Ukraine to do his political bidding. It did not even garner a majority vote, failing 48 to 52, with Mr. Romney voting with the Democrats. The second article, charging Mr. Trump with obstruction of Congress for an across-the-board blockade of House subpoenas and oversight requests, failed 47 to 53, strictly on party lines.\nLike this one, the trials of Presidents Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton also ended in acquittal \u2014 a reflection of the Constitution\u2019s high burden for removing a chief executive.\n\nBut in a stinging rebuke of the country\u2019s leader aimed at history, Mr. Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, said that Mr. Trump\u2019s pressure campaign on Ukraine was \u201cthe most abusive and destructive violation of one\u2019s oath of office that I can imagine.\u201d Though he voted against the second article, Mr. Romney became emotional on the Senate floor in the hours before the verdict on Wednesday as he described why he deemed Mr. Trump guilty of abuse of power, calling it a matter of conscience. He was the first senator ever to vote to remove a president of his own party.\n\u201cI am sure to hear abuse from the president and his supporters,\u201d Mr. Romney said. \u201cDoes anyone seriously believe I would consent to these consequences other than from an inescapable conviction that my oath before God demanded it of me?\u201d\nMr. Romney\u2019s defection, which he announced a couple of hours before the final vote, was a stark reflection of the sweeping transformation of the Republican Party over the past eight years into one that is now dominated almost entirely by Mr. Trump. And it deprived the president of the monolithic Republican support he had eagerly anticipated.\nStill, the White House declared victory.\n\n\u201cToday, the sham impeachment attempt concocted by Democrats ended in the full vindication and exoneration of President Donald J. Trump,\u201d said Stephanie Grisham, the White House press secretary. \u201cAs we have said all along, he is not guilty.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s re-election campaign moved quickly to capitalize on the moment, distributing a fund-raising email declaring, \u201cSorry haters, I\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d\n\nSeveral Republican senators ultimately acknowledged the heart of the House case \u2014 that Mr. Trump undertook a concerted pressure campaign on Ukraine to secure politically beneficial investigations into his rivals, including former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., using nearly $400 million in military aid as leverage.\n\nBut most argued that the conduct was not sufficiently dangerous to warrant the Senate removing a president from office for the first time in history \u2014 and certainly not with an election so near. Others dismissed Democrats\u2019 arguments altogether, insisting their case was merely an attempt to dress up hatred for Mr. Trump and his policies as a constitutional case.\n\nSenators Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, two Republican swing votes who have tilted against the president in the past, both voted against conviction and removal. And two Democrats from traditionally conservative-leaning states, Senators Joe Manchin III of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, voted to convict Mr. Trump, denying him  the bipartisan acquittal he coveted.\n\nAlthough the verdict was never in doubt, Democrats lobbied to expand the scope of the Senate trial to include witnesses and documents that the president refused to provide during the House inquiry, working to pressure vulnerable Republicans facing challenging re-election contests, like Ms. Collins, to join them or risk being portrayed as beholden to Mr. Trump. All but two Republicans refused, making the trial the first impeachment proceeding in American history to reach a verdict without calling witnesses.\n\nAs they closed their case, the seven Democratic House managers who prosecuted it warned that Mr. Trump would emerge only emboldened in his monarchical tendencies and that those who appeased him would be judged harshly by history. Republicans, they said, had chosen to leave the president\u2019s future up to voters despite evidence that he had tried to cheat in the election, and would continue to do so.\n\nSeldom used in American history, impeachment is the Constitution\u2019s most extreme mechanism for checking a corrupt or out of control officeholder. In unsheathing it, Democrats took on political risk that could backfire in November on their presidential nominee or their incumbents in Congress, including moderates in conservative districts and states where Mr. Trump is popular.\n\nAt least one Democrat, Senator Doug Jones of Alabama, glancingly acknowledged that his vote to convict would most likely contribute to his loss this fall in deeply conservative Alabama.\n\u201cThere will be so many who will simply look at what I am doing today and say it is a profile in courage,\u201d Mr. Jones said before the vote. \u201cIt is not. It is simply a matter of right and wrong.\u201d\n\nFor now, the impeachment of Mr. Trump appears to have evenly divided the nation. Public opinion polls suggest that even though a growing number of Americans agreed that the president most likely abused his office and acted improperly, more than a slight majority never agreed that he should be removed from office.\n\nIf Mr. Trump\u2019s standing among the public has been hurt by the trial, it is not yet evident. To the contrary, the latest Gallup poll, released on Tuesday, showed that 49 percent of Americans approved of his job performance \u2014 the highest figure since he took office three years ago. The same survey showed that Republicans\u2019 image has improved markedly, with 51 percent viewing them favorably compared with 43 percent in September.\n\nThe possibility of impeachment has hung over Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency virtually since it began, but Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, initially resisted it. After Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel who investigated Russia\u2019s election interference in 2016 and possible collaboration with the Trump campaign, found 10 instances of potential obstruction of justice by Mr. Trump, she said impeachment was too divisive a remedy to pursue.\n\nHer calculations changed in September with the emergence of an anonymous C.I.A. whistle-blower that accused the president of marshaling the powers of government to press Ukraine to investigate Mr. Biden and a theory that Democrats had colluded with Ukraine in the 2016 election. In authorizing the impeachment inquiry, Ms. Pelosi tasked the House Intelligence Committee to investigate the scheme and build a case.\n\nMr. Trump issued a blanket directive to all government agencies not to comply with the inquiry, robbing investigators of key witnesses and facts that could have filled out their case, and ultimately giving rise to the obstruction of Congress charge.\n\nStill, more than a dozen administration officials came forward, offering testimony in private and then in scintillating public hearings that confirmed and expanded on the whistle-blower complaint. On Dec. 18, the House impeached Mr. Trump on both counts.\n\nTo protect his Senate majority as much as the presidency, Mr. McConnell promised a swift acquittal \u2014 and he delivered it. It was just 20 days from the time the articles of impeachment were first read on the Senate floor to Wednesday\u2019s vote. By comparison, the Clinton trial in 1999 lasted five weeks, and in 1868, the Senate took the better part of three months to try Johnson.\n\nThe final shift in defenses by all but the most conservative of Mr. Trump\u2019s allies came last week, when The New York Times reported the first in a series of articles revealing that in August, Mr. Trump told John R. Bolton, the former national security adviser, that he would not release the military aid for Ukraine until the country helped out with investigations into Mr. Biden and other Democrats.\n\nImpeachment was seriously contemplated for a president only once in the first two centuries of the American republic; it now has been so three times since the 1970s, and two of the past four presidents have been impeached.\n\n"
